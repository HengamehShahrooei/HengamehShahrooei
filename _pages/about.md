👩‍💻I’m a recent graduate in Industrial Management from the University of Tehran. 

🔬My research interests are in using tools like AI, machine learning, blockchain, and digital twins to make supply chains more efficient, sustainable, and easier to manage in real life. 

🌍I deeply care about this field because I truly believe that as we work to improve people's lives and make everyday processes more convenient, we also have responsibility to take care of our planet. I hope to contribute to creating smarter, greener systems that preserve the Earth for the future.
