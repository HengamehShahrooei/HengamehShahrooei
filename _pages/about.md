👩‍💻I’m a recent graduate in Industrial Management from the University of Tehran. 

🔬My research interests are in using tools like AI, machine learning, blockchain, and digital twins to make supply chains more efficient, sustainable, and easier to manage in real life. 

🌍I truly  believe that information and knowledge are what can save the world, and I want to play a role in this mission.
